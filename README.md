# Interpreters
Where I practice developing interpreters for various programming languages in C++

Currently: Following along the "Let's Build a Simple Interpreter" guide at https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/. Am translating the Python Code to C++ code as practice.

Goal: To develop an LOLCODE interpreter in C++. Because why not.
